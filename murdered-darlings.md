#### Basic assumptions of digital macaroni

Digital macaroni art is a 2D rendering of a 3D physical medium. So what can be rendered in 2D to mimic 3D?

* Choice in position
* Shadows
* Layering
* Constrained size/shape

#### Comparable macaroni art programs

* [Dinner Not Art](https://dinnernotart.com/)
  * An art program for children by Kraft, intended to be played on a tablet to "stop food waste".
  * ["Kraft Digitizes Macaroni Art, Angers First Grade Teachers"](https://www.fastcompany.com/1681136/kraft-digitizes-macaroni-art-angers-first-grade-teachers) by [Joe Berkowitz](https://www.fastcompany.com/user/joe-berkowitz) ([Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/), 2012)
  * Per an [archived ad](https://youtu.be/pxU79r2cgz0?si=bCdQ34PskIO6XmHT), the "macaroni" could be expanded with a pinch (unrealistic) and "painted" with a touch through a paintbox interface (more colors and effects than typically available in physical macaroni art). Limited ability to layer, unclear light source, very "clean" and smooth appearance compared to the chunky irregularity of formed pasta.

* [Macaroni Draw neal fun](https://macaroni-art.pages.dev/)
  * A free, browser-based art program written in Javascript and CSS.
  * Can choose multiple shapes, but can't place or position them individually. The shapes are dropped along a dragged line at "randomly" rotated angles. The lines can be layered, but there are no shadows. There's no option to delete (remove) the macaroni without clearing the entire picture (unrealistic).
 
* [Macaroni Art](https://www.amazon.com/Lodestone-Animation-Inc-Macaroni-Art/dp/B0090XFKSU)
  * A Kindle Fire app from 2012 with multiple drag-and-drop shapes that can be increased or minimized in size, rotated, or flipped.
  * Has all the elements defined by the basic assumptions of digital macaroni: constrained (realistic) sizes, choice in position, shadows, and layerable. Shapes include unrealistic food items, though, and the direction and position of the implied lighting (as indicated by the shadows) never changes. The color of the shapes also can't be manipulated in a way that simulates what can be done with physical macaroni art.
