* Copied README into a new file (progress-notes) to allow for progress notes
* Updated README to start documentation of fictional language "maCart"
* Realized did not know whether all commands had to have the same number of bits
* Tried to ask other coworkers
* Took more than one of them to give a consistent answer
* Had a terrible time trying to figure out how Math can be described without pictures

* Gave up and made pictures anyway
* Realized I probably wrote too much stuff about the other art programs out there and the self-imposed constraints of the art
* Created murdered-darlings file and moved all that text from README into there

###### created: January 16, 2025

* Created repository, created README
* Wanted 1 shape with a lot of options, thought of macaroni while commuting
* Discovered that there's truly a dearth of macaroni-art-related videos that aren't either (1) creepy or (2) deeply weird but kind of fascinating in their weirdness
* Checked to see if other macaroni-art programs already out there
* There are, but they're weird too (and don't mention the upsides of Macaroni Art as described by the (2)-type videos
* Came up with several commands of varying lengths (2 through 5, seemed questionable though)
